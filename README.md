A personal website for Jayme Woogerd created in Ming Chow's Web Development (Comp
20) class.

---

All the pages are valid HTML/CSS. The only direction that I did *not* follow
was to include a photo of myself (but I did use one as a background image). 
This project took me about four or five hours (on the snow day!).
