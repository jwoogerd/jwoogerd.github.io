        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Jayme! I am a first year master's student studying 
        computer science at Tufts University. I grew up in the Ballard 
        neighborhood of Seattle, Washington and received my undergraduate 
        degree from Bowdoin College in 2007, double-majoring in physics and 
        classics. At Bowdoin, I played four years of NCAA Division III 
        women's ice hockey and softball.</p>
        <p>When I'm not at the keyboard hacking on code, I'm generally running
        around in the terrible New England weather training for a marathon (or
        two), plotting my next travel plans, or pining over tiny houses.</p>
        <p>You can also listen to my radio show every Monday morning 
        from 7-8am on Tufts' freeform radio station, 
        <a href="http://wmfo.org/">wmfo.org</a>!</p>
