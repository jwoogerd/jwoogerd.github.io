          Hello, I'm Jayme! I am a full-stack software engineer
          at <a href="https://www.plethora.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plethora</a>,
          a San Francisco-based manufacturing startup. These days I spend most of my professional time
          writing JavaScript, but I have a special place in my heart for functional
          programming languages.

        <p>
          Raised in Seattle and educated in Maine, I live in Boston and work in San Francisco -
          when I'm not on a plane, you can find me <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13201496"
          rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">running around</a> in the terrible
          New England weather, reading about personal finance, or plotting my next travel adventure. ðŸ¦ž
